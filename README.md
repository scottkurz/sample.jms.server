# sample.jms.server

Liberty JMS sample

This sample project contains a simple JMS Servlet application called JMSSample. JMSSample listens for HTTP requests sent to `localhost:9124/jms11-JMSSample`, and responds with various actions.
There are 2 main Servlets that are contained:

1. P2P : Point-to-Point Messaging uses JMS Queue to send and receive messages.  It also contains MDB message send and response.

2. PubSub : Publish-and-Subscribe Messaging uses JMS topic to send and receive messages.

Note: The Server and Client versions of the sample are currently the same except for the server.xml. There is a sample client server.xml in the src/main/liberty/config directory.
